## Look here 👋

This is Lipuyari.

Life is full of outrageous events and people, but for me it's even more outrageous, and that's where the name came from!

From the Chinese pinyin "li-pu-ya-ni" for "离谱呀你", to replacing the "n" with an "r" to make it sound better, i.e. "Lipuyari". 

Though I'm not sure what such a name looks like to a native English speaker.

==The following explanation is from ChatGPT (3.5):==

> "Lipuyari" as a name might seem a bit unusual from the perspective of a native English speaker. Here are some considerations:
>
> 1. **Pronunciation**: native English speakers may be unsure of how to pronounce a name accurately, especially if there are uncommon phoneme combinations in the name. Unclear pronunciation may lead to others not remembering or mispronouncing the name.
> 2. **Spelling**: The name looks complicated in spelling and does not conform to common English name spelling patterns. This may cause others to misspell it.
> 3. **Cultural background**: Many English names have a specific cultural or historical background, whereas "Lipuyari" does not have such a connection and may be unfamiliar to people.
> 4. **Uniqueness**: It is very unique and will surely impress people. But at the same time, a unique name may attract extra attention.



## About me

I'm from China, the world's most populous country (used to be 😓 not so long ago), and Indians are so awesome!!!! 👍

### Hobbies

I have a wide range of interests.

- ✨Anime, anime is a great thing, apart from my beliefs, it's a big part of my outlook. I long for the colourful world of anime, but that doesn't mean I have a disregard for reality. On the contrary, anime works with substance are always showing me that the real world I live in is just as wonderful. (Watching anime when emo really helps 😭)
- 🎮Games, this game thing really makes me love and hate, love because it really makes me feel another more comprehensive art in addition to anime; hate for a lot of reasons, at that time, I really came across a lot of excellent games, but many games do not have built-in official Chinese language, which makes me in the Internet non-stop looking for game Chinese patches, and many games optimisation! I can't say the same for the optimisation of many games, and that's you - my world in Java. (Luckily I can install modules now 😫 )
- 🎵 Music, is there really anyone who hasn't had the experience of listening to music while doing homework? My favourite types of music are also very varied, almost all over the place; all kinds of instruments, genres, styles, languages, all of them have been "tasted" by my ears. Good music can also improve the efficiency of work, anyway, every time I am called to do housework, listen to some European and American music style, rhythmic songs, that brush the dishes and mop the floor efficiency is not too high.
- 💪 sports, 🏀 basketball, played; 🏸 badminton, played; 🏓ping-pong, played; ⚽ football, kicked; 🎱 billiards, guided; ⛰ hiking, climbed; 🛹 skateboarding, skated; 🚲 cycling, riding for six years in middle school; 🏃‍ running, from a young age; 📖 homework, endless writing. (What? Of course writing homework is considered a sport!!!! Who doesn't get tired of writing homework? It's AI, it must be AI!!!)



### Education

Doesn't every Chinese have these two endings for every school they graduate from:

- Getting better (but after I graduated, it just didn't work out for me).
- Disappear. (I'd like to come back and miss it.)

I'd like to come back and miss it. Maybe there's another ending: getting better and then disappearing.

**Kindergarten**: huh? The director and his wife got divorced and the kindergarten is no more?

**Elementary School**: Hmm? Just graduated to nothing? The site became a food company? You used to call it a "central primary school"...is it central but not important?

**Junior High School**: Hmm? Just graduated from the building of plastic runway, not the Education Bureau said the pollution of the environment do not give the building? (I'm not going to use it anyway.)

**High School**: Hmm? How come you're the only one who hasn't changed? (Please reflect on this.)

**College**: Huh? I haven't graduated yet? That's okay then. 

**Graduate student**: huh? Just hate the lack of intelligence.
